# Email tag address generator

[中文](README.md) · English

Generate `name+tag@mail-domain` addresses in your browser, use a different tag for each website, and export the list as TXT. This generates addresses; it does not create mailbox accounts.

Requirements: a browser and a mailbox that supports plus addressing. Python 3.10+ is recommended for local serving; iCloud and custom domains are compatibility experiments only.

## What it does

- **Recognizes the platform** — detects Gmail and Microsoft / Exchange Online addresses and generates per their rules.
- **Handles your own domain too** — iCloud and arbitrary domains get an explicit "compatibility experiment" mode, because **unverified behavior shouldn't be dressed up as a promise.**
- **Accepts several input formats** — plain addresses, `address----extra field`, and Gmail's two-line format.
- **Scales** — 1–50,000 tagged addresses per mailbox, capped at 200,000 per run, so a slip of the hand doesn't kill the browser tab.
- **Controllable output** — optionally keep the original address, keep the extra field, and choose one-line or two-line format.
- **Extra fields are stripped by default** — and even when you keep them, the on-screen preview only ever shows a mask.
- **Four global themes** — Daylight, Celadon, Dusk, and deep gray, remembered in the current browser.
- **No external dependencies** — no remote fonts, analytics scripts, API calls, or third-party runtime.

## Getting started

Requires Python 3.10 or later; the runtime uses only the standard library.

```bash
python scripts/serve.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.

You can also open `index.html` directly, but the local server adds a fuller set of security response headers (plus a 10-second connection deadline, a 64-worker cap, and bounded single-line request logs).

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Public deployment, reverse proxying, and upgrades are covered in [deployment](docs/部署说明.md).

## Exactly how far each platform is supported

This section is deliberately verbose, because the distinction **matters**: generating an address is not the same as mail being delivered to it.

| Mode | What the tool does | Basis and limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto-detect | Handles Gmail and Microsoft only | Recommended default |
| Gmail | Generates `name+tag@gmail.example` | [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9282734): tagged addresses arrive in the current inbox |
| Microsoft | Generates Exchange Online plus addressing | [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/plus-addressing-in-exchange-online): on by default, but an org admin can disable it |
| iCloud | Generates candidates only if you opt in | Apple documents [existing iCloud aliases](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/mm6b1a490a/icloud) and [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/create-and-edit-addresses-mm1a876f7aed/icloud) — **dynamic `+tag` is never promised, so test it yourself first** |
| Any domain | Generates candidates | Whether it delivers is entirely up to your provider |

It only generates receiving addresses: it **doesn't create mailbox accounts, sign in, read mail, or bypass any site's rules.** Also worth knowing: some sites reject addresses containing `+` outright.

## Privacy by design

What you paste in may contain passwords, app-specific passwords, client identifiers, or refresh tokens. So the project is designed on the assumption that **the input is a secret**:

1. The page sets `connect-src 'none'` — **there is no upload channel at the browser level**, rather than a promise not to upload.
2. User content never enters `localStorage`, logs, or the URL. Only the theme name persists.
3. Extra fields don't reach the output by default, and the preview always masks them.
4. Downloads are created from an in-memory `Blob`; no server is involved.
5. `.gitignore` covers TXT files, private directories, data directories, and export directories, reducing the chance of an accidental commit.
6. Every example in the repository is fictional content written from scratch — none of the author's original account data.

## Worth noting technically

**Input size is bounded before splitting.** Pasted content is capped at 5 MiB of characters and 100,000 lines **before** line-splitting, diagnostics keep only the first 200 entries, and the final UTF-8 output has its own 32 MiB ceiling. The way a pure front-end tool dies is somebody pasting an 80 MB file, so the limits come first.

**`connect-src 'none'` is a hard guarantee.** That CSP directive makes it impossible for the page to issue a network request at all — even with a bug in the code or a poisoned dependency, there's no exit. That's more reliable than any privacy statement.

**The CI security gates actually run.** Ruff, Bandit, pip-audit, detect-secrets, CodeQL, and preview-asset validation all run in CI, and Gitleaks runs over the working tree and **full Git history** before any public release.

The detailed threat model, CSP, and release gates are in [technical and security notes](docs/技术与安全.md).

## Verification

```bash
node --test tests/alias-core.test.js
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py" -v
python -m compileall -q scripts tests
```
